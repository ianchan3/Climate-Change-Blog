    <h2>Climate Change is here NOW. We can limit further warming and the dangers it posesâ€”if we act now. Every fraction of a degree matters.</h2>
    <h2>What WE do between NOW and 2030 will determine whether we can slow warming enough to avoid climate change's worst impacts. We must drastically cut emissions and remove some carbon from the atmosphere. Fortunately, plants naturally absorb and store carbon</h2>
